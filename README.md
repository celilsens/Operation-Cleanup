# 🎮 Unity First Day Project

This is a simple 3D game demo developed on my very first day of learning Unity. The project helped me experiment with basic game mechanics.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Character movement
- 🌲 Basic environment setup
- 🌐 WebGL support
- 🔊 Sound effects
- 🧍 Anti-tipping scripts and character control

## 🛠️ Built With

- Unity 2022.3.x
- C#

## 🌐 WebGL

The project includes a WebGL build, but it is excluded from Git tracking. You can host it on your own server (e.g., GitHub Pages, itch.io) to make it playable online.

## 📂 How to Run

1. Open the project via Unity Hub
2. Launch the `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity` scene
3. Play and explore!

## 🤝 Contributing

This is an open-source learning project. Suggestions, pull requests, and feedback are always welcome.

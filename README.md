# üéÆ Unity First Day Project

This is a simple 3D game demo developed on my very first day of learning Unity. The project helped me experiment with basic game mechanics.
You can play this game at [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/en/games/3b919a66-e38c-42c4-b7dd-69d7268f83c8/webgl-builds). 

## üöÄ Features

- üéÆ Character movement
- üå≤ Basic environment setup
- üåê WebGL support
- üîä Sound effects
- üßç Anti-tipping scripts and character control

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- Unity 2022.3.x
- C#

## üåê WebGL

The project includes a WebGL build, but it is excluded from Git tracking. You can host it on your own server (e.g., GitHub Pages, itch.io) to make it playable online.

## üìù Notes
Keep in mind that this is a first day project. 
There are a few bugs/issues in the game that I noticed, but I started this project with a challenge,
To make it a true "Day One Project", it would take no more than 24 hours to develop this project. 
That's why I couldn't fix all the bugs/issues you see in the game in 24 hours. I tried my best.
